# css-dna-animation
Animation produced utilising html and css. Vue component ready for implementation produced from this code. 

TechStack: HTML | SCSS | CSS

Goal: I set out to make an animation using html and css. This feature needed to be convincing as a representation of DNA while also being usable on a web-app/website.

Features:
The animation can be easily modified using the SCSS variables
More strands can be easily added by duplicating strands and duplicating the delay animation css with a couple of modifications to the nth-child targets.
